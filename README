This set of ebuilds targets of providing packages for cross-compilation under
linux for mingw32 (and, in future, probably mingw64 platform)

* Emerge crossdev:

# emerge -av crossdev

* Crossdev cross-compile toolchain:
# crossdev -t i686-mingw32

* Add this repo to PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable of 
  /usr/i686-mingw32/etc/portage/make.conf 

* Emerge package you want:

# i686-mingw32-emerge -av mingw32-gtk+:2 # for gtk-2
# i686-mingw32-emerge -av mingw32-gtk+:3 # for gtk-3

Or any other package you like

! DO NOT ! try to install this packages with regular emerge. it will fail and  
           probably break your system. You're warned.
